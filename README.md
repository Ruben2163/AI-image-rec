AI-Image-Recognition

This projects has been made to create a AI model using a CNN to classify images 

The codebase will be written in python using tensorflow and keras and will uses datasets such as:
  CIFAR-10
  CIFAR-100
  Tiny-ImageNet-200
To train the model


The modules and libs being used are the following:
  Tensorflow
  Keras
  Preprocessing
  Matplotlib
  Pillow
  NumPy
