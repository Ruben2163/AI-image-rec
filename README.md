#AI-Image-Recognition
This Repo is no longer being updated
you can still use this code but it saves to a .h5 not sacetensors or .keras file unfortunatly

This projects has been made to create a AI model using a CNN to classify images 

The codebase will be written in python using tensorflow and keras and will uses datasets such as:
  CIFAR-10
  CIFAR-100
  Tiny-ImageNet-200
To train the model


The modules and libs being used are the following:
  Tensorflow
  Keras
  Preprocessing
  Matplotlib
  Pillow
  NumPy



We have made a basic AI benchmark with creating models using Tensorflow
We have had a model that can tell between happy and sad people
We have more a model that can tell between cirlces and squares
We have made a model that can tell between the minecraft plains and desert
